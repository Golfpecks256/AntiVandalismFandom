# CVNAdvanced

IRC bot for listening on Wikia CVN channels (`#cvn-wikia` and
`#wikia-discussions` on Freenode) and transferring message
information over multiple transports.

Documentation on how to use it is in `docs` directory.

Built with Node.js, webhooks, cubes, stars, bricks, bots, parrots, whales,
washing machines and probably many more I can't remember at this time.

## To Do
- I18N
- Coloring in CLI controller
- More commands
- Secure connection to IRC
- More efficient hook handling
- Error: write after end when stopping/restarting through commands
